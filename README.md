# DustBusterAI-Software
Sub-repository of DustBusterAI project which aims to develop an AI-powered, fully autonomous, differential-vehicle floor cleaning robot,
implementing AI-based cleaning solutions for robot using ROS2 framework, simulating and monitoring in Gazebo and RViz.
Robotic algorithms developed mainly in Python and C++ using ROS2 Humble which will run on an embedded computer NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

## Introduction

The DustBusterAI project aims to develop an autonomous cleaning robot that can clean indoor environments with minimal human intervention. The robot uses artificial intelligence and computer vision algorithms to navigate through the room and detect areas that need cleaning. The robot is equipped with a differential-drive system, cleaning mechanism, and other peripherals that allow it to perform its cleaning tasks.

## Custom Packages

In addition to standard ROS2 packages, the DustBusterAI-Software repository includes custom packages that are specific to the DustBusterAI project. These packages include source code for the robot's control system, motion planning algorithms, and data processing scripts.

**This section is currently incomplete but will be added in the near future.**
## Custom Plugins

The DustBusterAI-Software repository also includes custom plugins that extend the functionality of Gazebo and other simulation tools. These plugins include sensor plugins, actuator plugins, and visualization plugins that allow the team to simulate and test the robot's behavior under various conditions.

**This section is currently incomplete but will be added in the near future.**

## Simulation

To test and evaluate the DustBusterAI robot, the repository includes simulation and configuration files for Gazebo. The team has implemented solutions inspired by pre-AI simulations and prepared a real-world environment in Gazebo simulations. The simulations allow the team to test and validate the robot's performance under various conditions and scenarios.
